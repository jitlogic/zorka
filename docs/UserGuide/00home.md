Zorka is a powerful general purpose monitoring agent for your Java application servers. It is designed to
integrate seamlessly your Java applications with popular monitoring systems. Zabbix, Nagios, systems using
SNMP or JMX protocols are supported, UNIX syslog protocol is also implemented. Zorka features dynamic JMX
beans creation functions with dynamic attribute getter objects, aggregates and rank lists, bytecode
instrumentation and beanshell scripting. With all these things it is possible to monitor applications that
haven't been implemented with monitoring in mind with arbitrary granularity. Even monolithic applications
(with no application server infrastructure at all) can be instrumented and monitored in detail. With Zorka
you can step out of traditional monitoring limitations and do things that normally have to be implemented by
application developers, for example auditing.
